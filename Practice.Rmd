```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
x <- seq(1, 10, 1)
y <- seq(1, 50, 5)

df <- as.data.frame(cbind(x, y))

plot(df$x, df$y)
```

#add my own data to rmd file
```{r}
sample <- read.csv("growth measurements.csv")

sample_lm <- lm(Bud_growth ~ Species*Light, data = sample)
sample_anova <- anova(sample_lm)
sample_lm_output <- summary(sample_lm)

sample_anova
sample_lm_output
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
