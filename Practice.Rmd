```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
x <- seq(1, 10, 1)
y <- seq(1, 50, 5)

df <- as.data.frame(cbind(x, y))

plot(df$x, df$y)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
